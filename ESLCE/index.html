    <h1>ESLCE: A Dataset of Emotional Sounds from Large Crowd Events</h1>
    <p>
        The Human-like ability to recognize emotion from speech has been an interesting field
        of research for quite a while now. In contrast, the emotion recognition from the sound
        of the crowd is a relatively new domain. Crowds express emotion as a collective group
        where the individual sounds combine together to make up emotions like cheering,
        booing, clapping, etc. As a result, recognizing emotion from crowd sound is very
        different from recognizing emotion from an individual's speech. Moreover,
        the lack of any large and diverse dataset makes it harder to perform machine learning
        analysis in this domain. In this paper, we present a relatively large and diverse
        dataset of the emotional sound of crowds collected from 70 different large crowd
        events. We collected data for 3 different types of emotion and organized the
        dataset into 5 different folds each containing a unique set of events.
        The diversity and organization will ensure the reliability of a machine
        learning model trained on this dataset. We also discuss the effectiveness
        of 34 different features and 2 analysis techniques on the proposed dataset.
        The dataset has been made publicly available for the community.

        <b>Dataset Description:</b>
        The dataset is composed of audio recordings only from
        real-life large crowd events and any kind of synthetic or
        studio recorded sound clips were avoided. The audio was
        collected from audience-recorded videos of large sports
        events, concerts, movie theaters, and other crowd gatherings.
        The sports events include both international and domestic
        football, cricket, basketball, baseball, wrestling, and other
        similar types of events. In these types of sports events,
        usually there are two groups of supporters and as a result,
        these events are good sources for collecting the different
        types of emotional sound. People also collectively express
        their approval and disapproval in concerts, movie theaters,
        or political gatherings and, audio samples from these events
        were also included in the dataset. <br><br>

        Audio recordings from large events sometimes contain
        the sound of an individual person talking (e.g. commentary
        during a sports event) along with cheering or booing of the
        crowd in the background. The audio samples in which these
        types of individual sounds were dominant were rejected. But
        some samples in the dataset still contain the sound of talking
        of an individual as long as it is not significantly dominant
        than the crowd emotion sound in the background. <br><br>

        The Proposed dataset contains audio samples from <b>70</b>
        different crowd events of different genres. There are a total
        of <b>214</b> audio clips with a total duration of <b>3797</b> secs which
        is greater than any existing dataset in this particular domain.
