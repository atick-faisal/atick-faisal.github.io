    <h1>ESLCE: A Dataset of Emotional Sounds from Large Crowd Events</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        The Human-like ability to recognize emotion from speech has been an interesting field
        of research for quite a while now. In contrast, the emotion recognition from the sound
        of the crowd is a relatively new domain. Crowds express emotion as a collective group
        where the individual sounds combine together to make up emotions like cheering,
        booing, clapping, etc. As a result, recognizing emotion from crowd sound is very
        different from recognizing emotion from an individual's speech. Moreover,
        the lack of any large and diverse dataset makes it harder to perform machine learning
        analysis in this domain. In this paper, we present a relatively large and diverse
        dataset of the emotional sound of crowds collected from 70 different large crowd
        events. We collected data for 3 different types of emotion and organized the
        dataset into 5 different folds each containing a unique set of events.
        The diversity and organization will ensure the reliability of a machine
        learning model trained on this dataset. We also discuss the effectiveness
        of 34 different features and 2 analysis techniques on the proposed dataset.
        The dataset has been made publicly available for the community.
